<h3>Cognitive biases</h3>

"Systematic pattern of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment."
<br/>***-Wikipedia***

"Systematic error in thinking that affects the decisions and judgments that people make."
<br/>***-www.verywellmind.com***

"A cognitive bias is when you take a bad choice thinking that is a good choice."
<br/>***-People in the street, probably***

<h3>Causes</h3>

Bias can arise from various processes.

Some of them are:

* Brain's information processing capacity (limited)
* Emotional and moral motivations
* Social influence

---
<h3>Some Examples</h3>

* Confirmation bias
* Anchoring bias
* Pro-innovation bias
* Survivorship bias
* Optimism bias

<h4>Reason</h4>

Convenience, doesn't challenge ideas.

<h3>Anchoring Bias</h3>

<h4>Reason</h4>

Convenience, it's harder to estimate numbers or information you don't know.

Neither should a ship rely on one small anchor, nor should life rest on a single hope. 
<br/>***-Epictetus***

---
<h3>Status-quo Bias</h3>

Preference for current state of affairs.

"Resistance to change"

<h4>Reason?</h4>

Guess.

"Change your life today. Don't gamble on the futute, act now, without delay"
<br/>***-Simone De Beauvoir***

<h3>Optimism Bias</h3>

Tendency to believe that you are at a lesser risk of suffering a negative event compared to others.

* "I don't think I'll get cancer if I smoke."
* "Relax. Your presentation will be well received."

<h3>Why care at all?</h3>

* Allows to know ourselves and understand some limitations of human perception
* To make better and rational decisions
* Understand others' people actions and behaviours

---
<h3>Summary</h3>

* We are all biased.
* There are many cognitive biases and they all affect our decisions
* If we are aware of these biases, we can minimize their effect
* Human memory is really poor
* We think we are rational, but we're not fully rational all the time
* Important for understanding ourselves and relate effectively with others
